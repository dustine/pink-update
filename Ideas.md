# TO-DO
- Add recipe advancements for Rose everything

# Ideas
## Enchanted fire
- Purple (pink?) fire from enchanted flint n steel
- Enchantments possible: Unbreaking, Mending, *Looting*, *Damage Enchants*
- Italic enchants will propagate to the fire, that should have an enchanted shim
- Player like kills on soulfire?

## Rusting Iron Blocks

## Azalea wood
- Wishlist: Thinner trunk with branches towards any closeby leaves
  - Two states: Orientation (U/N/E) and Branches (1/L/I/T/X)
  - See how fences do it?
  - Have both kinds of logs, allow other logs to become branches?
- Returns pink planks!

## Coin system
- Mint (one-way) items into coins: Copper, Iron(?), Gold, Diamond(?)
- Add copper nugget. Like. Come on.
- This is this far down bc it'll require a custom interface, for minting, and possibly seeing about stack sizes above 64
